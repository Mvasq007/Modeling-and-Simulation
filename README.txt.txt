Purpose of this project was to take an existing piece of software (provided by the professor)
and change it to our needs. 

Original software was a model for a bus service at an airport. 
Project was done pairs and consisting of taking the airport service and creating an elevator
Floors would be randomly generated, be put on a day/night cycle and generate random about of people based on time

Ex: Mornings would have MUCH more people on the first floor going up, but evenings would see a more even distribution and be going down

We would set the elevator on a timer for time to open/load/close, time and time to traverse a floor. 

Then would calculate averages based certain events.
